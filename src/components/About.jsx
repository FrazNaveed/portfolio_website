          I am a BTA certified blockchain developer, having rich experience in
          developing production grade Smart Contracts on EVM compatible
          blockchains. As a blockchain developer, Iâ€™ve created many smart
          contracts for different use cases. I am also comfortable with MERN
          stack. I have developed pixel perfect frontends using React.js,
          Tailwind Material UI, Sass etc, connected them with API Backends and
          further connecting them to smart contracts. I have hands-on experience
          with architecture patterns, Test Driven Development, secure coding
          practices & deep understanding of the tech stacks. I am a self-starter
          & a team player with clear communication skills.
